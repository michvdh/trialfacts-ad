              Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) causes a slight but noticeable
              decline in mental abilities, such as memory loss and impaired
              thinking. People with MCI have a much higher risk of going on to
              develop dementia.

              Previous research has shown that regular exercise may help improve
              brain health and prevent dementia. This study is comparing the
              effectiveness of three different kinds of exercise on memory and
              thinking abilities.

              This study seeks men and women aged 60+ who have noticed a slight
              decline in their memory and/or other mental abilities.
              Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three different
              exercise training groups: a) Strength training group, b) Aerobic
              training group, or c) Balance, toning & mobility training group.
              Participants will be invited to attend 3 supervised exercise
              sessions per week for 12 months at the research site in Lidcombe.
